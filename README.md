# libft

42 C Library. The first project at 42 Silicon Valley.

At 42, we were only allowed a handful of functions from the C standard library. 
Instead we each had to recreate our own from scratch. libft (Library Forty-Two) contains over 
60 functions that served as the foundation for many projects.

Build with the `make` command
